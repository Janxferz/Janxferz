                    <em>Alias Origin</em>
                </h3>
                <p>On April 19, 2013, I created a Youtube account.
                    <br>A Youtube account that's name changed a lot over time.
                    <br>From just being my first and middle name, to the last
                    <br>one I can remember being bUck bUmble, this account went
                    <br>through A LOT of aliases. It wouldn't be until May 18,
                    <br>2016, that I would come up with the alias known as
                    <br>"Janxferz." At the time, my cousin and I wanted to make
                    <br>a Youtube channel where we would post Youtube Poop videos.
                    <br>We wanted to come up with a good name for the channel,
                    <br>and personally, while this will sound weird, I wanted a
                    <br>username that not only sounded cool, but looked cool. At
                    <br>some point, I thought of the name, "Jinx" and wanted to make
                    <br>a sort of spinoff to that name, since it seemed like such a
                    <br>common username. I ended up thinking of the username,
                    <br>"Janxferz47" which my cousin and I both liked. However, it
                    <br>wouldn't be until months later, that I would decide to take
                    <br>the 47 out of the username, leaving it at just, "Janxferz."
                    <br>And with all that being said, that's how the username,
                    <br>"Janxferz" pronounced, "Jane-ks-ferz" came to be.</p>

                    <em>Making Stuff</em>
                </h3>
                <p>When it comes to making stuff, whether it's music,
                    <br>a video game, or even a website, I'm kind of just
                    <br>all over the place. The reason I say that is because
                    <br>when it comes to something like a youtube video or
                    <br>music, I just finish it all in one day and do it
                    <br>really fast. I don't really take time with things
                    <br>like those and just, "Oh this sounds good,"" and then
                    <br>proceed to post it wherever. However, if it's something
                    <br>like gamedev, I only work on it when I want to in order
                    <br>to maintain quality. Overall though, when it comes to
                    <br>making things, the hardest part of making something, at
                    <br>least for me, is starting the creation. For some reason,
                    <br>most of the time, I will get an idea, and then proceed to
                    <br>try that idea, only to realize that I've only got an
                    <br>extremely small portion of the idea, and don't know where
                    <br>to go from there. I usually will have to sleep on it for a
                    <br>few days, possibly even longer than just days, until
                    <br>something crosses my mind, and I try it.
                    <br>Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, but if it ended
                    <br>up not working out, All I do is say to myself, "I'm doing
                    <br>this for fun, not to be the best" and just move on.
