                    <p>
                        LogHead is an alter ego of Janxferz.
                        Originally having his name show up in
                        the album cover of Janxferz's album,
                        "FuFu Fuckface," LogHead is Janxferz
                        from another dimension. He was
                        originally sent to Janxferz's
                        dimension to get info on what
                        other dimensions are like. However,
                        after losing contact with his team,
                        LogHead was now stuck in Janxferz's
                        realm, and had to live life there for
                        a while until he could get back to
                        his dimension. LogHead has said
                        previously that he met Janxferz at a
                        Speedway Gas Station. As the story goes,
                        LogHead was working the night shift,
                        until at 3:00 a.m. when Janxferz came in.
                        Looking for a Faygo, Janxferz asked LogHead
                        if they had any, to which LogHead ended up
                        starting a conversation with Janxferz about
                        how they both enjoyed Faygo. This conversation
                        ended up with Janxferz asking LogHead for his
                        contact, and about a month later, Janxferz
                        contacted LogHead, asking about a collaboration.

                    <p>
                        To be honest, I'm not entirely sure why I'm
                        into Vaporwave so much. Maybe it's the
                        bright and sort of pastel colors,
                        maybe it's the calming and retro
                        music that gives me a weird feeling
                        of nostalgia, maybe it's the art with
                        all of the busts and statues. Whatever
                        it is, I'm really into it for some reason
                        that I can't quite place my finger on.
